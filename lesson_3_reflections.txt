1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when you want to have access to the files from different locations

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because there may be some changes you don't want to make public yet

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- I would use fork when I want to clone another repository, make some changes on it and share it later on my GitHub repo. Clone when I want to use a remote repository to work on my PC or just to use it as it is. And Branches if I want to collaborate in some remote repo by adding a personal branch to it if the admin of that repo does not allow me to work on master branch
