1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

-Because you can search for typos, missing characters, etc.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- To view changes that could be useful for other projects.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

- Pros: control of changes, easier to read and understand
- Cons: you may forget making commits or missed some important changes

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- Because sometimes you don't need dependencies or related files to save them together

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- To keep track of my changes

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

- because I cal always go back in good versions

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

- For my current C projects
